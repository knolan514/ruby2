        <p id="intro">"An Italian sports car manufacturer founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939. Ferrari S.p.A. is an Italian sports car manufacturer based in Maranello. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940. However, the company's inception as an auto manufacturer is usually recognized in 1947 when the first Ferrari-badged car was completed.

        Ferrari is the world's most powerful brand according to Brand Finance.[4] In May 2012 the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history, selling in a private transaction for US$38.1 million to American communications magnate Craig McCaw.[5]

        Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50 percent of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90 percent in 1988.[6] In October 2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its intentions to separate Ferrari from FCA; as of the announcement FCA owned 90 percent of Ferrari.[7][8][9] The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrari N.V. (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari group and the subsequent sale by FCA of a 10 percent of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[10] Through the remaining steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with a 10 percent continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari.[11] The spin-off was completed on 3 January 2016.[10]

        Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it is the most successful racing team, holding the most constructors championships (16) and having produced the highest number of winning drivers (15).[12] Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth.[13]" - Wikipedia</p>

          "Above sports cars, there are exotic sports cars and then there’s the LaFerrari. While the coupe is no longer sold, rumors hint at a topless Spider model. Expect it to have the same 789-hp V-12 as its hardtop predecessor, with a 161 hp boost from an electric motor. That’s right, it’s a hybrid—enabling it to accelerate like a Bugatti Chiron while achieving somewhat respectable fuel economy. Far prettier than its predecessor, the Enzo, the LaFerrari is styled like a ground-bound fighter jet. Making the performance even more remarkable is that the LaFerrari is rear-wheel drive. Ferrari’s launch control is easy to actuate and rips off consistent runs, but the 918’s four-wheel drive gives it an initial advantage. So the LaFerrari’s 2.5-second 0-to-60 romp can’t match the Porsche’s 2.2-second time to 60 mph. Initial traction gets the 918 to 60 in 114 feet; the LaFerrari needs 119. Still, the LaFerrari is pushing on your chest with a full g of force through 70 mph and it doesn’t taper off much after that. In the rolling 5-to-60-mph test, which removes the aggressive launch, the LaFerrari posted a 3.0-second time. Beyond 60 mph, the 3489-pound LaFerrari’s superior power-to-weight ratio allows it to begin to pull away from the 3724-pound 918. The Ferrari’s combined 950 horsepower yields a 3.7-pound-per-horsepower ratio; each of the 918’s horses moves 4.2 pounds. In the Ferrari, the century mark passes in a what-the-hell-was-that 4.8 seconds—one-tenth quicker than the 918. And there’s the aforementioned advantage to 150. At one of our normal testing venues, we could have pushed well past 150 mph, but at Fiorano we had to be hard on the brakes a blink after the speedometer indicated that speed." - Car and Driver

        <h3>488 GTB</h3>

          "The Ferrari 488 (Tipo F142M) is a mid-engined sports car produced by the Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari, introduced in 2015 to replace the previous 458. It is powered by a 3.9-litre twin-turbocharged V8, smaller in displacement and higher in output than the 458's naturally aspirated engine. The 488 GTB was named "The Supercar of the Year 2015" by car magazine Top Gear. The 488 GTB is powered by a 3902cc (488cc per cylinder, thus the name) all-aluminium dry sump unit of the Ferrari F154 engine family.[3] Turbocharged with two parallel ball-bearing twin-scroll turbochargers supplied by IHI/Honeywell and two air-to-air intercoolers, the compressor wheels are made of low-density TiAl alloy often used in jet engines to reduce inertia and resist high temperatures within the turbocharger. The engine produces 670 PS (493 kW; 661 hp) at 8,000 rpm and 760 N·m (561 lb·ft) of torque at 3,000 rpm.[5] This results in a specific power output of 126.3 kW (171.7 PS; 169.4 hp) per litre and specific torque output of 194.8 N·m (144 lbf·ft) per litre, both records for a Ferrari car. The first 488 to be introduced was the 488 GTB 2-seat berlinetta, successor to the 458 Italia. It was launched on 3 February 2015, in advance of its world première at the March 2015 Geneva Motor Show.[1] Claimed manufacturer performance for the 488 GTB is 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 3.0 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.3 seconds, covering the quarter mile in 10.45 seconds and continuing to a top speed in excess of 330 km/h (205 mph).[3]" - Wikipedia

        <h3>F12 Berlinetta</h3>

          "Sure, it costs more than a house, but the metal-melting aria from that incredibly operatic engine—priceless. The F12berlinetta is everything you could want from an Italian supercar. Power comes from a 730-hp 6.3-liter V-12, mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic with rear-wheel drive. Even with all that power, the F12berlinetta is one of Ferrari’s more comfortable cars, making it a true daily-driver. For the ultimate, there’s the F12tdf, with 769 hp and downforce-improving aero add-ons. To build its latest red-blooded creation, Ferrari first ruined a perfectly good car. In transforming the sure-footed F12berlinetta grand tourer into the fast-and-loose, apex-hounding F12tdf, Ferrari engineers deconstructed the stability that’s inherent in the F12’s long wheelbase, its substantial weight, and its high polar moment of inertia relative to mid-engined cars. The front tires grew in width from 255 millimeters to 285 millimeters, an aggressive alignment boosted turn-in and lateral grip, and—with no change to the rear tire width—a fickle, oversteering monster was born. One Ferrari chassis engineer described the team’s work bluntly: 'First, we screwed up the car.'Shorter gear ratios throughout the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle are augmented with quicker shift times. We project a 2.8-second blast to 60 mph on the way to a 10.8-second assault on the quarter-mile. The always-on nature of the big-displacement, naturally aspirated 12-cylinder engine demands a delicate right foot on corner exit, but the pedal obliges with long, linear travel. When it’s time to reverse thrust, a brake pedal with just as much fidelity activates a carbon-ceramic braking system borrowed from the LaFerrari hypercar." - Car and Driver
