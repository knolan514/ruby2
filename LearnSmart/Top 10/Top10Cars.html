    <h2 id="lamborghini">6. Lamborghini</h2>
      <p id="intro"> "Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian: [lamborˈɡiːni] ( listen)) is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi. In 2015, Lamborghini's 1,175 employees produced 3,248 vehicles.[14]

        Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with established marques, including Ferrari. The company gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.

        New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent. Lamborghini produces sports cars and V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing. Lamborghini currently produces the V12-powered Aventador and the V10-powered Huracán." - Wikipedia

      <h3>Centenario</h3>
      <img class="car_img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Lamborghini_Centenario_1.jpg"/>
        <p>"At the upper echelon of the auto industry, the most exclusive brands are increasingly cashing in on limited editions and one-offs. Few companies do it as often as Lamborghini. Its history with such cars has been hit-or-miss, but its ­latest, the Centenario, meaning the “centenary,” belongs in the former cat­ego­ry. Intended to celebrate the 100th birthday of the brand’s founder, Ferruccio Lamborghini, it is faster and lighter than the Aventador LP750-4 Superveloce and packed with technology that will migrate to series-production cars. Lamborghini’s engineering team squeezed even more power out of its glorious 6.5-liter V-12. Code-named L539, the over-square 60-degree perfect dozen is essentially the same naturally aspirated unit that rages under the hood of the Aventador SV. But revisions to the variable valve timing and the intake and exhaust systems mean it is now rated at 770 PS, or 759 horsepower. That’s up 19 horses on the SV, and the redline stretches another 100 rpm, to 8600. As in the Aventador, the power routes to all four wheels through a seven-speed automated-manual gearbox. We expect the same 2.7-second zero-to-60-mph time for the Centenario as we saw in the Aventador SV. For people whose private runways stretch the required distance, the Centenario will hit 186 mph (the even 300-km/h mark) in less than 24 seconds. Research and development boss Maurizio Reggiani wouldn’t tell us the top speed, but says the Centenario is governed somewhere “beyond 217 mph.” - Car and Driver

    <h2 id="rolls">7. Rolls Royce</h2>
      <p id="intro"> "Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited engineers, manufactures and distributes luxury automobiles and automobile parts worldwide. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW established in 1998 after BMW was licensed the rights to the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo from Rolls-Royce PLC and acquired the rights to the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grill shape trademarks from Volkswagen AG. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited operates from purpose-built administrative and production facilities opened in 2003 across from the historic Goodwood Circuit in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United Kingdom. Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Limited is the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce branded motor cars since 2003.

Although the Rolls-Royce brand has been in use since 1906, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship to Rolls-Royce branded vehicles produced prior to 2003. The Bentley Motors Limited subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to Rolls-Royce Motors and various other predecessor entities that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars between the foundation of each company and 2003, when the BMW-controlled entity started producing cars under the Rolls-Royce brand.

The Rolls-Royce Phantom four-door sedan was the first product offered for sale in 2003. Since then, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has expanded its product line up to include an extended wheelbase version of the Phantom sedan, a Phantom two-door coupé and Phantom convertible version and the less expensive Ghost four-door sedan and Wraith two-door coupé." - Wikipedia

      <h3>Wraith</h3>
      <img class="car_img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/2014_Rolls-Royce_Wraith,_diamond_black_fR.jpg"/>
      <p>"The Wraith is derived from the Ghost, but it has its own distinct—some might say sporting—personality. With a 624-hp version of the Ghost’s V-12, the wheelbase is shorter and the fastback body is unique. The Wraith is quicker and more nimble than the Ghost, with a light touch to the steering and a gently controlled ride. Rolls tradition abounds, with rear-hinged power doors, the available Starlight headliner, and an array of options that can launch the already-lofty base price into high orbit. Contrasting paint notwithstanding, the new Wraith has been cast as the performance-minded Rolls-Royce, though the company is eager to add that the Wraith is no sports car. So just in case you thought a 5500-pound, 17-plus-foot-long vehicle with power-operated doors was a sports car, know that you would be wrong. The Wraith’s 624-hp twin-turbocharged V-12 is the most powerful engine offered in any of the company’s cars, and we expect that it will carry the Wraith to 60 mph from a standstill in 4.3 seconds. And it will do so with a measured thrum from the exhaust that only plays background to whatever soundtrack you’ve chosen to pipe through the Naim audio system. There is no way to justify the cost of a roughly $300,000 car, unless, of course, you have $300,000. That’s about where the Wraith will start, significantly higher than the cost of the Bentley Continental GT. But let’s say you want a headliner with 1340 individual fiber-optic lights to simulate the starry firmament, all inserted and trimmed by hand. Well, that’ll be $12,925 more. If you want the Santos Palisander–covered door panels, budget for another $12,500. And maybe none of the five upper-body and 29 lower-body paint color options is to your liking. More money." - Car and Driver

    <h2 id="porsche">8. Porsche</h2>
      <p id="intro"> "Dr.-Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, usually shortened to Porsche AG, is a German automobile manufacturer specializing in high-performance sports cars, SUVs and sedans. Porsche AG is headquartered in Stuttgart, and is owned by Volkswagen AG, which is itself majority-owned by Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Porsche's current lineup includes the 718 Boxster/Cayman, 911, Panamera, Macan and Cayenne. Porsche is the most successful brand in motorsport, scoring a total of more than 28,000 victories, including a record 16 constructor wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Porsche is currently the world's largest race car manufacturer. In 2006, Porsche built 195 race cars for various international motor sports events. In 2007, Porsche is expected to construct no fewer than 275 dedicated race cars (7 RS Spyder LMP2 prototypes, 37 GT2 spec 911 GT3-RSRs, and 231 911 GT3 Cup vehicles). A Canadian study in 2011 revealed that 97.4 percent of Porsches from the last 25 years are still on the road." - Wikipedia
      <h3>918 Spyder</h3>
      <img class="car_img" src="http://media.caranddriver.com/images/media/331369/follow-the-acid-green-line-15-things-we-learned-on-the-porsche-918-factory-tour-photo-643323-s-450x274.jpg"/>
        <p>"It took Porsche years to develop a worthy successor to the vaunted Carrera GT supercar, but at last, the 918 is here—and it’s a plug-in hybrid! With a combined 887 hp and 944 lb-ft of torque from its mid-mounted V-8 and electric motors—one at each axle—the 918 delivers Bugatti-like acceleration, tenacious handling, and a 211-mph top end. And of course, it’s every bit as exotic-looking as any near-million-dollar supercar should be, with a low-slung, targa body, and ultra-futuristic cabin. There’s no family-hybrid-esque Atkinson-cycle four puttering away beneath the 918’s perforated engine cover. Think, instead, high-output V-8 bristling with modern engine technology. Porsche says the engine was derived from that in the Le Mans class-winning RS Spyder, but you really need to stretch the definition of “derived” for that to be the case. In large part, the only commonalities between the RS Spyder’s 3.4-liter and the 918’s 4.6 are that they both have flat-plane cranks and 90-degree vee angles, and saying that 90-degree vees on two eight-cylinders implies shared roots is like claiming you and Billy Joel must be cousins because you both have goatees. The V-8 makes 608 horsepower, three more than in Porsche’s previous limited-edition flagship, the Carrera GT. But the 918 then adds roughly the output of another old flagship, the 930 Turbo, via two electric motors. One wedges in between the V-8 and seven-speed PDK transmission; the other sits aft of the front cargo hold. The battery pack sits low behind the passengers within the carbon-fiber monocoque. Total system output from the engine and motors sits at 887 horsepower and a maximum of 944 lb-ft of torque. (For even more details on the 918’s powertrain and its operation, check out technical director Don Sherman’s prototype drive here.) We weren’t able to gather instrumented test data, but figure on a 0-to-60-mph time of 2.6 seconds and a quarter-mile time of about 10 flat. And in case you missed it, the 918 Spyder is the first production car ever to break the seven-minute barrier at the Nürburgring. Not only that, but Porsche’s drivers say they were told to exercise caution and insist they could do better than the 6:57 they stamped into the record books. Chalk one up for hybrid goodwill." - Car and Driver

    <h2 id="mercedes">9. Mercedes Benz</h2>
      <p id="intro">"Mercedes-Benz is a global automobile manufacturer and a division of the German company Daimler AG. The brand is known for luxury vehicles, buses, coaches, and trucks. The headquarters of Mercedes-Benz is in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The name first appeared in 1926 under Daimler-Benz, but traces its origins to Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and to Karl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first gasoline powered automobile. Mercedes-Benz's slogan is "The Best or Nothing". Mercedes-Benz is one of the most recognized automotive brands worldwide. Mercedes-AMG GmbH, commonly known as AMG, is the high performance division of Mercedes-Benz. AMG independently engineers, manufactures and customizes Mercedes Benz AMG vehicles. Mercedes-AMG is headquartered in Affalterbach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. AMG was originally an independent engineering firm specializing in performance improvements for Mercedes vehicles; Daimler-Benz AG took a controlling interest in 1999, then became sole owner of AMG in 2005. Mercedes-AMG GmbH is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler AG. AMG models typically have more aggressive looks, a higher level of performance, better handling, better stability and more extensive use of carbon fiber than their regular Mercedes counterparts.[2] AMG models are typically the most expensive and highest-performance of each Mercedes-Benz class.[2] AMG variants are usually badged with two numerals, as opposed to regular Mercedes-Benz vehicles which have three (e.g. C 63 as opposed to C 350).[3] Traditionally, the two numerical digits signified the engine's displacement size, however, recent models have deviated from such correlation."- Wikipedia

      <h3>AMG GT-R</h3>
        <img class="car_img" src="http://ridingmode.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2017-Mercedes-AMG-1.jpg"/>
        <p>"What It Is: A track-devouring version of the already ravenous AMG GT, with more power, a revamped chassis, and a wider body    with unique front and rear treatments and a prominent rear wing.
        Why It Matters: In the mold of the previous gullwing SLS, which went through similar iterations, the AMG GT R will transform the GT from sporty grand tourer into a large and somewhat-heavy supercar. The GT R is the first of what’s expected to be an almost annual series of special models over the GT’s seven-year life span.
        Platform: Like the base model, the GT R will be built on the aluminum platform that is an evolution of the SLS architecture.
        Powertrain: The GT R will receive an upgraded version of Mercedes-AMG’s twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 with around 550 horsepower. Future special editions likely will top 600 horsepower.
        Competition: Acura NSX, Audi R8 V-10, Ferrari 488GTB, Lamborghini Huracán, McLaren 570S, Porsche 911 GT3 RS.
        What Might Go Wrong: Nothing whatsoever. In fact, the only thing that could go wrong is AMG not doing these high-performance derivatives and letting its sporty cars go stale. But rest assured that something so tragic wouldn’t happen. AMG can sell every GT R it cares to produce.
        Estimated Arrival and Price: The GT R will be unveiled at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in June; prices will approach $200K." - Car and Driver

        <p id="intro">"Tesla Motors, Inc. is an American automotive and energy storage company that designs, manufactures, and sells      electric cars, electric vehicle powertrain components, and battery products.[5][6][7] Tesla Motors is a public company that trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol TSLA.[8] During the first quarter of 2013, Tesla posted profits for the first time in its history.[9] Tesla first gained widespread attention following their production of the Tesla Roadster, the first fully electric sports car.[10] The company's second vehicle is the Model S, a fully electric luxury sedan, which was followed by the Model X, a crossover. Its next vehicle is the Model 3.[11] Global Model S sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in December 2015, three and a half years after its introduction.[12] The Model S was the world's best selling plug-in electric vehicle in 2015.[13] As of June 2016, the Model S ranks as the world's second best selling plug-in car in history after the Nissan Leaf.[14] As of 30 June 2016, Tesla Motors has sold almost 140,000 electric cars worldwide since delivery of its first Tesla Roadster in 2008.[15][16] Tesla manufactures equipment for home and office battery charging, and has installed a network of high-powered Superchargers across North America, Europe and Asia.[17] The company also operates a Destination Charging program, under which shops, restaurants and other venues are offered fast chargers for their customers.[18] CEO Elon Musk has said that he envisions Tesla Motors as an independent automaker,[19] aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer.[20][21] Pricing for the Tesla Model 3 in the United States, slated to begin retail deliveries by the end of 2017, will start at US$35,000 before any government incentives." - Wikipedia

      <h3>Model S P90D</h3>
        <img class="car_img" src="http://carsautonew.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016-tesla-model-s-p90d-price.jpg"/>
         <p> "Tesla’s product architect, Elon Musk, must have been watching a Mel Brooks marathon on TNT when he picked “Ludicrous Speed,” straight out of Spaceballs, as the tag for the fastest acceleration mode in his Model S P90D. And indeed, one must have balls from outer space to fully exploit this car’s launch performance. To sort heroic acts from hype, we ran this electric missile through our test gantlet with, shall we say, shocking results. Cutting to the chase, it’s the first production car with four doors to crack the 3.0-second zero-to-60-mph barrier, doing it in 2.8 seconds. In 30-to-50-mph passing acceleration, it trumps the Tesla Roadster Sport’s all-time record run of 1.5 seconds, also by two-tenths of a second. The P90D’s 11.1-second, 121-mph quarter-mile run, achieved with no hint of tire smoke or exhaust ruckus, merits VIP parking at NHRA headquarters. The Model S P85D in Insane mode, formerly the quickest Tesla, was a half-second slower to 60 and 0.7 second and 7 mph poki­er in the quarter-mile. Due care is necessary to achieve these results. Options that add ballast, including the Model S’s huge sunroof, rear-facing seats, and second battery charger, must be avoided. It’s a $38,000 upgrade from a base Model S 70 rear-drive version to obtain the most-potent electric motors, the four-wheel drive, and the long-range 90-kWh battery pack. Then add the $10,000 ­Ludicrous Speed option to enable the on-demand disappearing services. A full ­cardiac work-up is recommended for ­anyone interested in experiencing Tesla’s ­latest abuse of common sense."
