  <h2 id="aston">3. Aston Martin</h2>
  <p id="intro">"Aston Martin Lagonda Limited is a British manufacturer of luxury sports cars and grand tourers. It was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford.

    The firm became associated with luxury grand touring cars in the 1950s and 1960s, and with the fictional character James Bond following his use of a DB5 model in the 1964 film Goldfinger.

    The company has had a chequered financial history, including bankruptcy in the 1970s, but has also enjoyed long periods of success and stability, including under the ownership of David Brown, from 1947 to 1972 and of the Ford Motor Company from 1994 to 2007.

    In March 2007, a consortium of investors, led by David Richards, purchased 92% of Aston Martin for £479 million, with Ford retaining a £40 million stake.[4] David Richards became chairman of Aston Martin. In December 2012, the Italian private equity fund Investindustrial[5] signed a deal to buy 37.5% of Aston Martin, investing £150 million as a capital increase. Aston Martin was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford.[8] The two had joined forces as Bamford & Martin the previous year to sell cars made by Singer from premises in Callow Street, London where they also serviced GWK and Calthorpe vehicles. Martin raced specials at Aston Hill near Aston Clinton, and the pair decided to make their own vehicles.[9] The first car to be named Aston Martin was created by Martin by fitting a four-cylinder Coventry-Simplex engine to the chassis of a 1908 Isotta-Fraschini.[10][11]

    They acquired premises at Henniker Mews[12] in Kensington and produced their first car in March 1915. Production could not start because of the outbreak of World War I, and Martin joined the Admiralty and Bamford the Royal Army Service Corps. All machinery was sold to the Sopwith Aviation Company." - Wikipedia

    <h3 id="astn">One 77</h3>
    <img class="car_img" src="http://www.exoticcarlist.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2009-aston-martin-one-77-9.jpg"/>



    <p>"The name is made clear when you learn that only 77 will be produced, but that’s where this limited-edition roadgoing race car stops making sense. A carbon-fiber monocoque chassis, a superlight 7.3-liter V-12, and a hand-formed aluminum body put the price tag at almost $2 million. Wow. Aston Martin’s new GT, the One-77, seems to be an exercise in pushing the Aston brand even further toward the stratosphere. The idea behind the One-77 is to offer a personally tailored car to 77 wealthy customers prepared to part with as much as $2.5 million. Fundamentally, the One-77 is similar to its lesser kin, the DB9 and the Vanquish, but the V-12 engine has been enlarged to 7.0 liters and turns out 650 horsepower. The aluminum structure is replaced with a carbon-fiber composite hull, and the body is clothed in a new aluminum skin. Expect a show car next year that also will be shown to 500 potential customers that Aston has identified. It seems this ultra-exclusive Aston is not the rumored “DBX” replacement for the Vanquish, though some of the technology from the One-77 may find its way into that car. All that said, while the car is certainly extreme—and rather unbeautiful—for an Aston Martin, it may nonetheless disappoint folks expecting Lamborghini-style visual drama for their extravagant expenditure. Like Lambo’s ReventÃ³n, however, the One-77 will be very, very rare (only 77 are planned). Prodigious power and torque—some 700 horses and 516 lb-ft—will come from a 7.3-liter V-12. Aston’s most potent powerplant ever, the engine is a stretched-displacement relative of the 5.9-liter V-12 used elsewhere in the Aston range. It will be mated to a paddle-shifted automated manual transmission." - Car and Driver

        <h3>Vanquish</h3>
          <img class="car_img" src="http://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/10/2016/07/2016-aston-martin-vanquish-base-coupe-front-view.png"/>
          <p> "Aston Martin calls the Vanquish a “super grand touring” machine, not a super sports car; we say it’s so beautiful, we don’t care what Aston calls it. Yes, its sonorous, 568-hp V-12 makes it fast, but many sports cars easily out-accelerate it. It’s also sumptuous inside, if ergonomically challenged. Like to drive topless? Opt for the Vanquish Volante, for a truly rare ride. As with all Astons, its little flaws are all but forgivable, since it is one of the most lovely things on four wheels. Let’s start with what’s different. That’s pretty much one thing: the new eight-speed automatic transmission. Okay, so this is actually the same ZF gearbox that’s been used in many other sports cars, but to make it fit, Aston has gone to the considerable trouble and expense of reengineering it for the Vanquish’s transaxle layout. And although in the everyday part of the auto industry the arrival of more ratios inevitably signifies an economy boost, here it’s been done to increase performance. The old Vanquish was limited by gearing to a mere 183 mph, but now—with no other mechanical change—it can hit a claimed 201 mph. Yes, in this part of the market, these things matter. (Owners are much less likely to boast about the 2015 Vanquish’s 2-mpg improvement on the EPA highway cycle.)The 5.9-liter V-12 engine is unchanged from before. So there’s no need to say anything about it. We’re kidding. It would have been easy to turn this entire story into an overwrought teenage love poem dedicated to the engine’s sonorous charms. Because while the V-12 might not be able to match more-modern rivals on raw power, you will search the world in vain for a more charismatic powerplant. At low revs it burbles like a V-12 should, with a lazy, creamy wuffling that sounds like money. But as soon as you add revs, the noise hardens. Beyond 5000 rpm it’s delivering the sort of resonant wail that might well—if you drove past a cemetery on a Friday the 13th and under a full moon—reanimate several corpses." - Car and Driver

        <h3>DB11</h3>
          <img class="car_img" src="http://cdn2.theweek.co.uk/sites/theweek/files/2016/02/aston-martin-db11-cs1-1.jpg"/>
          <p> "Turning up its looks and performance literally to 11, the DB11 continues Aston Martin’s tradition of blending style and power. A twin-turbo 5.2-liter V-12 makes a brutal 600 hp and 516 lb-ft, teamed with a paddle-shifted eight-speed automatic. We estimate a 0-60 time of 3.9 seconds. A lightweight structure, torque-vectoring system, and stiff chassis result in impressively agile handling. Expect all the trappings of a modern Aston when the DB11 hits showrooms in late 2016, starting at $214,820. The V-12 is a very old, very antiquated answer to a very old, enduring question: How do you make a lot of power smoothly with a reciprocating engine? Nowadays, with balance shafts and miniature-marvel computers, a turbo four-cylinder does a pretty good job, and more than one company makes a buttery V-8 that wouldn’t tip over a standing nickel. Add direct injection and turbos and you have V-12 power without the size, weight, and moving parts. But there’s just something about sitting behind—or in front of—two inline-sixes married at the crankshaft. The V-12 is the triple-axis tourbillon of an increasingly quartz engine world, and it delights us precisely because of its excessive parts count. Oddly, Aston Martin considers itself a V-12 company, even though its most glorious David Brown era depended on inline-sixes. Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori won Le Mans behind one in 1959, and the straight-six served Aston well into the 1970s, when its attention turned to bulldog V-8s. The company didn’t get its first V-12 until 2001, a 5935-cc unit made by splicing together two Ford Duratec V-6s in a CAD program. Ferrari is a V-12 company; Lam­bor­ghini is a V-12 company; Jaguar is a V-12 company, though it hasn’t sold one in years. " - Car and Driver
