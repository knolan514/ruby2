    <h2 id="bentley">5. Bentley</h2>
      <p id="intro"> "Bentley Motors Limited is a British registered company that designs, develops, and manufactures Bentley luxury motorcars which are largely hand-built. It is a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG.[12] Now based in Crewe, England, Bentley Motors Limited was founded by W. O. Bentley on 18 January 1919 in Cricklewood, North London.
      Bentley cars are sold via franchised dealers worldwide, and as of November 2012, China was the largest market.[13]
      Most Bentley cars are assembled at the Crewe factory, but a small number of Continental Flying Spurs are assembled at the factory in Dresden, Germany.[14] and bodies for the Continental are produced in Zwickau, Germany. Bentley won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1924, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, and 2003.
      Iconic Bentley models include the Bentley 4½ Litre, Bentley Speed Six, Bentley R Type Continental, Bentley Turbo R, and Bentley Arnage. As of 2015, Bentley produce the Continental Flying Spur, Continental GT, Bentley Bentayga and the Mulsanne.
      Rolls-Royce bought Bentley from the receivers in 1931 and subsequently sold it to Vickers plc in 1980 when Rolls-Royce themselves went bankrupt. In 1998, Vickers sold it to Volkswagen AG. The sale included the vehicle designs, model nameplates, production and administrative facilities, the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grille shape trademarks, but not the rights to the Rolls-Royce name or logo which are owned by Rolls-Royce Holdings plc and were licensed to BMW AG." - Wikipedia

      <p>"One thing that has always separated Bentley from its former longtime partner Rolls-Royce is its racing heritage. Bentley trots out this factoid from time to time when it wants to go back to the track, as it did at Le Mans from 2001 to 2003 with the Speed 8 and as it is doing now with the Continental GT3 in the Blancpain Endurance Series in Europe and the Pirelli World Challenge here in the States. Whipping well-heeled motorsports fans into a froth over Bentley race cars doesn’t serve much purpose unless you can then give them something to buy. So along comes the GT3-R, a limited-edition brand stretcher intended to test the waters for even sportier Bentleys that may come down the chute later. Priced at $339,725, or more than $135,000 costlier than a base Continental V-8 S, the 300 copies of the GT3-R that Bentley says it will build will not be GT3s with license plates. In other words, the GT3-R is not a slammed, rear-wheel-drive racing shell with a sequential transmission, a roll cage, and a rather large Gatorade bottle. Instead, it’s a massaged Continental GT V-8 S that has been horse-whipped to 572 horsepower and 516 lb-ft, increases of 51 and 14. That’s a lot of sauce out of 244 cubic inches. Actually, there’s an overboost function that makes possible 592 horses and 553 lb-ft for 15 seconds, which is not long enough to get down the Mulsanne straight but more than sufficient to scare the caviar lunch out of your passenger." - Car and Driver
