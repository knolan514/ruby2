  <h2 id="McLaren.html">2. McLaren</h2>
  <p id="intro"> Despite roots going back to 1963 and Bruce McLaren Motor Racing, McLaren Automotive was launched in 2010 as a stand-alone manufacturer with a long-term business plan and a promise to launch a new car or a derivative every calendar year.

    "In 2014, McLaren Automotive achieved a second successive year of profitability. Revenue for the year increased by 67 per cent to £475 million and the company achieved a pre-tax profit of £15 million, a 233 per cent increase on 2013.[3]

    McLaren ended 2015 with another record year, delivering a total of 1,654 cars to customers across 30 markets. For the first time, McLaren Automotive has introduced a second shift at the McLaren Production Centre, driven by continuing global demand and linked to the forward orders of the new Sports Series. A total of 250 new roles have been created with 200 new appointments in Production, 30 in Quality and 20 in the Logistics department. Adding approximately 40 percent to the headcount will take production rates from 14 cars per day to 20 cars per day by mid-2016.[4] As announced during the 2014 financial results, the increase in production resource comes on top of added investments in Research and Development. In June 2015 McLaren Automotive announced that investment in R&D increased by 30 per cent to £91.8 million translating to 20 per cent of total turnover, with significant investment expected, funding R&D for new models, technologies and innovations.[5]

    McLaren’s retail network has also expanded bringing the total number of McLaren retailers to 71 across more than 30 countries. Growth was recorded across all four of the McLaren regional business units with Asia-Pacific seeing the biggest change with 11 new retail locations opening across the region, resulting in an 80 per cent rise in sales in 2014.[6]

    Accounting for more than 30 per cent of sales, the North American market remains the largest for McLaren, whilst Europe and the Middle East grew year-on-year by 10 per cent and nine per cent respectively.[7]

    In 2015, sales are forecast to continue growing, thanks to the recently launched Sports Series. McLaren’s long-term business plan aims for a total production of around 4,000 units by end of 2017 with a mix of series and limited-production cars. The Sports Series is expected to reach around 2,500 units with the introduction of all bodystyles in the range. By 2017, McLaren’s aim is to establish a network of around 100 retailers across all the key automotive markets globally." - Wikipedia

    <p>"The P1 is a superhero among supercars: supermodel shapely, heroically powerful, stratospherically expensive, and—here’s the one drawback—unavailable. That’s because all 375 examples of the million-dollar plus, 903-hp gas/electric hybrid land rocket have been sold. The technology amazes: There’s a 3.8-liter 727-hp V-8 paired with a 177-hp electric motor, hydro-pneumatic suspension, electro-hydraulically assisted steering, and even a rear wing that extends almost 12 inches. Ah, to be rich...Testing confirms the P1 will sprint to 60 mph in 2.7 seconds and continue pulling hard until it reaches its governed top speed of 217 mph. But as impressive as those numbers are, they are not unprecedented in the world of supercars. Hell, a Porsche 911 Turbo S will get to 60 mph in 2.6 seconds, and McLaren’s own F1 achieved a top speed about 20 mph higher back in the ’90s. What is so remarkable about the P1, of which 375 will be made, is its ability to corral a 727-hp twin-turbo V-8, a 177-hp electric motor fed by a lithium-ion battery pack, and a mass of power electronics into a cohesive whole that manages to smoothly and easily deliver a uniquely extreme speed experience.While you can drive the P1 for a claimed six or so miles solely on electricity, the real purpose of the engine-mounted motor is to smooth the power-delivery characteristics of the gasoline engine. McLaren started with a reengineered version of the 3.8-liter V-8 that powers the 650S. With bigger turbos strapped on, and running a healthy 20.3 pounds of boost, the P1’s gas engine is plenty enough propulsion. Each of the engine’s 727 horses is tasked with moving only 4.5 of the P1’s 3300 pounds. And that’s before you add the electric motor’s power to the mix. Meanwhile, a Lamborghini Aventador saddles each of its horses with 5.9 pounds." - Car and Driver

    <h3>675LT</h3>
    <p>
      <img class="car_img" src="http://www.car-revs-daily.com/file/2015/02/2015-McLaren-675LT-1.jpg"/>
      <br>
      "McLaren’s hot, new 675LT is a higher-performance variant of the 650S, and the LT portion of its name is derived from the wild 1997 F1 GT "Longtail" homologation special. That rare McLaren menaced the road with radically lengthened bodywork, racy aerodynamics, and a better power-to-weight ratio than the car on which it was based. The 675LT has two of those things, but its tail? Quite vestigial, we’d say.

      In fact, the 675LT is just 1.5 inches longer than the 650S, and it appears a decent stretch of that extra length comes from the sports car’s epic chin splitter. The rest goes to a slightly longer active rear spoiler that McLaren claims is 50 percent larger than the one fitted to the 650S. McLaren says that a “focus on outright performance, weight reduction, and ultimate levels of driver engagement” define a Longtail, so maybe we’re just being too literal. That said, the mighty F1 GT Longtail got more tail—the car was a full 25 inches longer than the regular F1—not to mention a full aero kit that entirely altered the supercar’s visuals. The same twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-8 bolted between the 650S’s rear wheels is present here, but McLaren massaged it for an extra 25 horsepower and 16 lb-ft of torque. While the car’s name is drawn from its 675 metric power, we tabulate its might as 666 devilish horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. With less McLaren to haul around, the V-8 punches the 675LT to 62 mph in a claimed 2.9 seconds—0.1 quicker than McLaren’s stated time for the 650S—and on to a top speed of 205 mph. The LT uses the 650S’s seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, and power is still routed to the pavement through the rear wheels." - Car and Driver

    <h3>570s</h3>
    <p>
      <img class="car_img" src="http://images.car.bauercdn.com/pagefiles/20771/mclaren-570s-002.jpg"/>
      "There are two members of the 570 family: the 570S and the 570GT; both are set to kick sand in the face of lesser sports cars. The S is sportier, while the GT is set up for long-distance-driving comfort. Both models have a twin-turbo 3.8-liter V-8 making 562 hp and 443 lb-ft, mounted behind the cabin; a carbon-fiber tub reduces weight and adds strength. A sequential seven-speed gearbox drives the rear wheels. The S is faster to 62 mph by 0.2 second; both models have a top speed of 204 mph. Under heavy braking, with its front tires loaded mightily as they near the edge of grip, the McLaren 570S reveals itself. In these telling seconds before the brake pedal is released and the steering wheel is turned, the 570S feels more organic than mechanical. More living tissue than aluminum and carbon. Like a great white shark, maw agape, arcing to carve through a sea lion, it destroys corners. Cleaves them clean through.

      It’s a machine that lives for the edge of grip, pleading to be pressed harder, driven in deeper, and throttled sooner. And it is spectacular. Despite modest rubber by class standards, the 570S circles the skidpad at 1.05 g, which is respectable but short of the 1.07 g we saw in our test of the 650S Spider and well behind the brain-crushing 1.19 g the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 offers." - Car and Driver
